<H1>Current Indicator For Small Solar Panels</H1>


<P>

For decades I have had this problem that I need to have some kind of
current indicator when charging my batteries from small solar
panels. Measuring the current just once does not work, because
seawater makes all conctacts so unrealiable.  Traditional solution has
been a blinking LED protected with a Zener, but the damn thing
wastes 4 Volts of valuable Voltage.
<p>
Design below wastes only 0.7 Volts and blinks always when anykind of
current is going in the right direction. In fact, because this also
replaces the reverse-current protecting diode, this wastes no voltage
at all. ("Any Diode" means of course any diode with 0.7V drop and suitable
current rating :-)

This is the optimal place for the charging indicator, so you
can keep the panel outside the tent and watch the blinking light and battery inside. Components are immersed in hot clue.
