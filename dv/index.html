SOLAR-POWERED DV-CAMERA</h1>

<p><br>Ok.You have got 3 months trip in some wet or dusty wilderness
ahead of you and you want to take your (Sony) DV-camera with you. You are interested of pictorial  <a href="../2000/index.html"">information</a> not some fartsy art. There
are some issues, I'mafraid:
<p>Issue #1: You cannot trickle-charge lithium batteries, like regular
NiMH-batteries. You have to get some  huge10W/12V solar-charger (and
hope for constant sunshine) and a car battery plug.
<p>Issue #2: When you try to connect some other form of energy source into
the power jack of a Sony it somehow recognizes that you are not using an authorized
power source.
<p>Issue #3:When the camera is kept *unpowered* in a Sony water-proof housing
(eg SPK-TRC), it drains the batteries nevertheless.

<p><b><i><font size=+1>And the answer is: -- You have to make a NiMH-battery-pack
of your own, regulate the voltage to 8.2 Volts and construct a power-switch.

The battery back is made of 8 AA-NiMH-batteries rubber-banded
 to the cover of SPK-TRC. A clip is the most reliable connector.

(Ok. The clear glass window is self-made. Attached with  fiberglass.)

The power switch is a small magnet pulling the reed-relay 
inside. Thumb-operated of course....

The reed-relay and the 8.2 Volt regulator is soldered into cardboard
and glued in place.
<p> <i> Is it legal to adjust the regulator voltage with
diodes at the ground connector?  (I did it anyway :-) </i>

Sony power cord is cut into pieces and decorated with tasteless clips..

Any kwestions? Please do not ask me.
