SOLAR-POWERED DV-CAMERA</h1>

<p><br>Ok.You have got 3 months trip in the some wet or dusty wilderness
ahead of you and you want to take your (Sony) DV-camera with you. There
are some issues, I'mafraid:
<p>Issue #1: You cannot trickle-charge lithium batteries, like regular
NiMH-batteries. You have to get a&nbsp; huge10W/12V solar-charger (and
hope for constant sunshine) and a car battery jack.
<p>Issue #2: When you try to connect some other form of energy source into
the power jack of a Sony it somehow recognizes that you are not using authorized
power source.
<p>Issue #3:When the camera is kept *unpowered* in a Sony water-proof gasket
(eg SPK-TRC), it drains the batteries nevertheless.

<p><b><i><font size=+1>And the answer is: -- You have to make a NiMH-battery-pack
of your own, regulate the voltage to 8.2 Volts and construct a power-switch.</font></i></b>
