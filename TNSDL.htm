	    <p>Originally <b>Timo Noko <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDL" title="SDL">SDL</a></b>. Set of telecommunication solftware programming tools
created by 
<a href="Timo_Noko.htm">Timo Noko</a>
in 1978-1990 while mostly employed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"">Nokia</a>
 using programming language
 <a href="Nokolisp.htm">Nokolisp</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly there was the TNGRAPH, a graphical tool to create the SDL-language spefication. Then there was the TNANAL to test the
overall validity of the specs. And thirdly there was the <a href="TNCODE.htm">TNCODE</a> macro processor to
produce the actual code to be used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_DX_200" title="Nokia DX 200">Nokia DX 200</a> telephone exchange.</p>
<p>Later (from 1990 onwards) TNSDL was totally revised by more qualified authors to implement the SDL-88 specification which
automatized the code generation phase.</p>

(Wikipedia now claims that TNSDL means Tele-Nokia-SDL from 1990. Really it does not. This  <a href="curricu/tnsdl.pdf">paper</a> was written in 1982, two years before I was employed by Nokia.)
