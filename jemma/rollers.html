<h1>Backpackers Rollerskates</h1>
<p>
In 1980's I tried to invent roller skates with better suspension, suitable for backpacking
<p>
They were rather good, but Inline skates are safer, because when you lose one wheel in a Quad, you fall on your face - always.
<p>
I tried to patent this design, but somebody had already done that - There was very similar US patent for  skate board suspension.
