<h1>The memory of S-memory</h1>


<p><p>
The S-memory <i> (S-expression-memory) </i>was made by hand soldering back-to-back <b>massive</b>
and <b>expensive</b> amount of dynamic 64 kbit memory chips. To be used with Osborne-1 CP/M-machine around 1982. <p>
 One word was 35 bits
wide, containing two 16 bit addresses and 3 bit tag field. Tag field
told if the address-fields contained numbers, symbols, machine code or
<a href=../Nokolisp.htm>Nokolisp</a>-node.
<p> Plans for automatic address latch was made, allowing
CAR/CDR-operation in memory itself.
<p>
 This memory was partially visible
in Osborne's address space. <p>
