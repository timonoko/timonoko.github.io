<h1>SOLAR-POWERED ETREX </h1>

<p><i>Gps units have unfortunate tendency to run out of power
just when they are needed most. While changing batteries in rain
with numb cold fingers whilst kayaking in Norway, I deciced to do
domething. These are some of the ideas I have been testing:</i> <br>

<p><b>Solar-charging battery compartment cover:</b> The panel
produces 33 mA and the unit consumes 150 mA... However with 1800
mA NiMH-batteries you have about 10 hours reserve. And when
batteries run out, you wait some 10-30 minutes and there is
enough juice to get a fix.. This is for casual user, most of the
time you keep it unpowered and upside down. </p>

<p>Water-proof and easy to make (out of heat-curing putty). I
could make &amp; sell these myself. <br>

<p><b>External Panel:</b> In this version I had six 33 mA panels
enclosed in a CD-box. There is enough energy to keep the Etrex
running continously. However there is some danger of overcharging
the batteries. Thats why you keep checking the battery status
indicator and keep the panel in shade when them batteries are
full. You have to apply some silicone putty to make the battery
box&nbsp; waterproof</p>

<p><b>Fool's Errata: </b>I have got several pieces of advice
telling me that <i>&quot;You cannot connect solar panel directly
to battery connector. You'll need Fuse, Diode and Charging
Circuit, otherwise severe damage or expolosion will occur.&quot; </i></p>

<p>I have got Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering and let
me assure that you can. Dangers in this case are: Overcharging,
Discharging, and Nukular Particles.... </p>

<p>You cannot overcharge 1800 mAh pack with 30mA source and
neither with 200 mAh if the source is constantly being drain by
150 mAh Etrex. And you'll need a discharging diode only if the
panel actually discharges battery, when kept in dark, preferably
of the type &quot;Schottky&quot;. You can add a Fuse to the
circuit, if it makes you happy. There is no harm, especially if
the fuse is rated for 10A 380V. </p>

<p>Sol emits indeed Nukular Particles and solar panels thus have
tendency to produce Nukular Energy, but the accumulation of these
particles can be avoided by using &quot;Green&quot; batteries.
NiMH-batteries are more &quot;Green&quot; than NiCd-batteries --
and usually labeled as such.. </p>

<p><i>If there is anything else you do not understand in this
application, please do not ask for anybody's advice and please do
not try to solve it on your own. Just forget it and stay home.
You should not be on your own in woods or at sea, with or without
GPS.. </i></p>
