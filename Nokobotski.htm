<b>Nokobotski</b> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_kayak" title="Folding kayak">Folding kayak</a> design by <a href="Timo_Noko.htm" class="external" title="Timo Noko.htm" rel="nofollow">Timo Noko</a>.</p>
<p>Nokobotski is covered with <b>One-Piece Skin</b>, which allows constructs like <b>Tube <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch" title="Hatch">Hatch</a></b> and makes the boat very rigid and tight without inflatable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponson" title="Sponson">sponsons</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>One-Piece Skin</b> is created by successively heating and stretching the polyester-reinforced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVC" title="PVC">PVC</a> skin until there is only one seam to glue on top of the boat. Because the skin material is somewhat thinner
(0.5 mm), a <b>second layer</b> (and possibly third) is then glued on to the bottom (piece-wise) while the skin is stretched.
Because the deck-material is now able to take the stress (unlike traditional canvas-covered decks) the bottom can be pulled much
tighter. Tightening is done with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunwale" title="Gunwale">gunwale</a> line.</p>
<p>The <a href="search.htm"><b>Tube Hatch</b></a> is made of deck material and can be rolled close just like regular waterproof <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag" title="Bag">bag</a>. The hatch is waterproof and safe even when not fully locked. The shape of the hatch is somewhat elongated so that
it can be stretched to allow objects of various shape to inserted. Because this hatch is so easy to make, there can be more than
two hatches in a bigger boat. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_sock" title="Sea sock">Sea sock</a> can also be used with these hatches.</p>
<p>Because of the hatches, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribs" title="Ribs">ribs</a> can be removed or inserted when the boat is fully
assembled. When the kayak is fully loaded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff" title="Stuff">stuff</a> for a longer trip, smaller ribs in
front and back are useless and prevent efficient use of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo" title="Cargo">cargo</a> space.</p>
<p>In the picture below, the kayak has an inflatable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger" title="Outrigger">outrigger</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel" title="Keel">leeboard</a>. These are for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing" title="Sailing">sailing</a> purposes, but do not
hinder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle" title="Paddle">paddling</a>.</p>
